# ZCONV :ribbon: :rocket: :heart_on_fire: :unicorn:

***A preddy lil' Vue.js app to convert between numbers of different bases.*** :ribbon: :rocket: :heart_on_fire: :unicorn:

## ABOUT :books:

A while back I wrote a library that provides functions to convert between numbers of base 2 and base 10. This library is live on NPM and can be viewed [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/zeppo). I decided to make a shiny frontend. The library was called ***Zeppo***, after the third Marx brother. This shiny frontend using the library is therefore called ***Z***eppo ***Conv***ert. Enjoy. :heart_on_fire:

## DEPLOYED PROJECT ON NETLIFY :rocket:

The deployed project can be viewed [here](https://gilded-sunflower-5a4e37.netlify.app/).

## USAGE :hammer:

***ZConv*** makes your life very easy. It provides you with two conversion modes, one for converting from base 10 numbers to base 2 numbers and one from converting from base 2 numbers to base 10 numbers. The first is called `dec` and the second is called `bin`. To switch between modes, simply press the `Switch Mode` button. To convert from one base to the other, type your number into the input field and press `Compute`. That's it. But! If you type something wrong, you might get a nasty surprise. :wink:
